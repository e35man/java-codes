this repo currently contains: 
1. bubble sort <br />
  (compare current and next element. if current is greater than next, swap)<br />
2. insertion sort <br />
  (compare current and previous element. if current is less than previous, swap till current is greater then previous to obtain a sorted partition after each iteration)<br />
3. selection sort <br />
  (find smallest element in unsorted partition of array and swap it with first element of unsorted partition)<br />
<br /><br /><br />
More to come soon...
