This repo currently contains:

1. Bubble Sort
   - Compare current and next element. If current is greater than next, swap.
   
2. Insertion Sort
   - Compare current and previous element. If current is less than previous, swap till current is greater than previous to obtain a sorted partition after each iteration.
   
3. Selection Sort
   - Find the smallest element in the unsorted partition of the array and swap it with the first element of the unsorted partition.
